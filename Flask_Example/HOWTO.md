<h2>This is a simple reproducible example that I was able to work out for MAC </h2>

<h2>It is essential to have the following technologies to implement this: </h2>
<ul>
<li>IPython Notebook or Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>PIP to install the necessary software (or be really savvy with git cloning)</li>
<li>Have MySQL installed</li>
<li>Run the .sql files in the folder to a new database named: Bucketlist (then you can run the procedure from the python call)</li>
</ul>
